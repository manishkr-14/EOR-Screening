# EOR-Screening
Screening EOR using Random Forest Classifier and Clustering 

It is initial step of EOR selection. Conventionally go/no/go approach was used which used ranges of values of Reservoir & fluid parameters for selecting EOR.

This project is divided in two parts:
1.Using Random Forest Classifier to predict the suitable EOR based on features
2.Using KNN Clustering to determine generalised set of rules for EOR Screening
